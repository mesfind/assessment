# The Carpentries Assessment

This repository contains assessment data, source code, and analyses for The Carpentries workshops and programmatic assessment.

The Carpentries teach core computational and data skills to researchers. We also train instructors to teach workshops on computational skills. We value a culture of assessment, and consistently assess learner outcomes from workshops (short term),  programmatic efforts (instructor training), and the long-term impact we have on learners.

Assessment projects are led by Kari L. Jordan, Director of Assessment and Community Equity. The data, code and reports in this repository are publicly available under the CC-BY 4.0 license. The projects in this repository are open for comments/feedback and collaboration.

# Content
