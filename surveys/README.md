# Explanation
+ Surveys **dc_presurvey_INUSE.pdf** and **dc_postsurvey_INUSE.pdf** are Data Carpentry's pre- and post-surveys in use as of 2017-10-27. The skills-based questions were removed, and inclusive language was added.
+ Surveys **dc_presurvey_skillsbased.pdf** and **dc_postsurvey_skillsbased.pdf** are no longer in use as of 2017-10-27. These surveys were piloted from 2017-08-07 to 2017-10-27 and included skills-based questions.
+ Surveys **dc_presurvey_archived.pdf** and **dc_postsurvey_archived.pdf** were in use from 2016-02-24 to 2017-10-25. There was a bit of lag time closing this survey out while we began piloting the skills-based questions survey.
