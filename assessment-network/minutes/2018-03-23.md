# Agenda
1. Tractenberg Webinar Follow-Up Questions (please add your questions below)  

a. For those who do not have experience with assessment, but wanted to get started, what do we do?!
  Some background from Kate: I joined the Carpentries with a small team from my university and a (relatively) larger   consortium of universities in New England; we're really interested in developing evidence about how workshop participants go on to use (or not) these skills.  
  
  Perhaps, links under http://www.datacarpentry.org/assessment-network could be starting points? 
  
  Definitely! And of course we need to clearly articulate what long-term outcomes we're interested in as a consortium, too -- right now that's a little fuzzy.
