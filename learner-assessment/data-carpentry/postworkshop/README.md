# About 
This folder contains data and analyses for Data Carpentry's post-workshop surveys. The purpose of our post-workshop survey is to compare changes in learner attitudes and motivation with respect to the tools covered in their workshop. We also collect feedback on learner's perception of their instructional team.

Learners are asked to provide a unique identifier that they use when completing both the pre- and post-workshop survey. This repository contains the paired analyses of those results to determine if there are significant gains in learners post-workshop responses.
