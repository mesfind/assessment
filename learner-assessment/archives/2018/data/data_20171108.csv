Motivation to learn more about software skills that can aid me in my work.,"The skills seem really helpful, but this was my 1st exposure to them and I did not finish the workshop feeling sufficiently confident in my proficiency to actually use them. There were a lot of topics to get through in a short amount of time (four topics in two days). If there had been time for an exercise in which I took what I learned and actually applied it to some aspect of my work with an instructor's feedback, I'd probably still be using the skills. But, because the exercises were self-contained and not all applicable to my work, I felt that it would be too difficult to set up an entire system for myself on my own after the workshop.  I'd take an entire multi-day workshop on Python or R, with one day being applied to personal work, if Carpentry offered this at my school. ","I really appreciated the patient instructors and supportive classmates at the workshop. There was one instructor (for Unix Shell) who was less patient with me when I didn't understand the jargon, so that lesson pretty much went over my head entirely. But the other lessons were great."

It helped tremendously with my confidence and prompted me to continue trying to learn even though I didn't have any real personal resources available in my day-to-day to ask questions.  So most importantly, just being exposed to people *talking* about R, the command line, and Linux (even though I didn't immediately understand it) and being genuinely interested in helping me learn was the best thing for me at the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes.,10,"I use R on a daily basis to work with large genomic data sets.    Instead of copy/pasting data tediously into Excel, I use R to analyze the data more efficiently and with less error.",,"I was a complete newbie to anything related to coding (no linux, no command line, no other languages).  It was most helpful for me to be in an environment with people that were genuinely interested in helping me learn and used jargon and language associated with coding. Even though I might not have fully understood every thing in that moment, it helped shape my development and gave me a positive outlook on learning.  I left the class excited to problem-solve my way to learning how to code and it has significantly changed my career progression."
